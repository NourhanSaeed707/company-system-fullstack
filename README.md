# Company System Fullstack
## Introduction:
- Welcome for our company project! This is a web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on company data, including employee and department information. The application also features user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- The system has separate roles for admins and users, with different levels of access and permissions. The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS and NextJS, providing a modern and responsive user interface. The backend is built using Java and Spring, with a MySQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- This README will provide you with all the information you need to get started with the project, including instructions for installation, configuration, and usage. We hope you find this application useful and easy to use for your company's data management needs.
